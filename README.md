# Singapore Weather Data Analysis (2020â€“2024)
ðŸ“Š Data Extraction, Cleaning, and Visualization Project

---

## Overview
This project showcases the end-to-end process of extracting, cleaning, and visualizing historical weather data for Singapore from 2019 to 2024. It highlights ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) concepts and tells a data-driven story suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

---

## Project Goals
- Extract and combine 5 years of historical weather data.
- Perform data cleaning and transformation.
- Visualize weather patterns using clear, intuitive charts.
- Present findings in a storytelling format for easy understanding.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** (Data Handling)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (Visualization)

---

## Data Source
- [Data Gov SG](https://data.gov.sg/) â€“ Historical 24-hour weather forecasts.

---

## Key Visualizations
1. **Monthly Average Humidity (2020â€“2024)**  
   ðŸ“ˆ Displays high and low humidity trends, highlighting Singaporeâ€™s consistently humid tropical climate.

2. **Monthly Average Wind Speed (2020â€“2024)**  
   ðŸ“ˆ Shows seasonal wind speed variations linked to monsoon seasons.

3. **Dominant Weather Forecasts (2020â€“2024)**  
   ðŸ“Š Highlights the most common weather types, emphasizing the dominance of thundery showers.

---

## Interpretation Highlights
- **Humidity** remains stable between 85%-95% (high) and 55%-65% (low), with minor seasonal fluctuations.
- **Wind Speeds** peak early each year during the Northeast Monsoon.
- **Thundery Showers** dominate forecasts, while rare weather events like haze are linked to regional environmental factors.

---

## How to Run
1. Install required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
2. Open Main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to generate charts and view the analysis.
---

## Future Improvements
- Add live weather data through APIs for real-time updates.
- Forecast future weather trends using machine learning.
- Compare Singaporeâ€™s patterns to neighboring ASEAN countries.
