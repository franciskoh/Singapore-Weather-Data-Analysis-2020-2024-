# Singapore Weather Data Analysis (2020–2024)
📊 Data Extraction, Cleaning, and Visualization Project

---

## Overview
This project showcases the end-to-end process of extracting, cleaning, and visualizing historical weather data for Singapore from 2019 to 2024. It highlights ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) concepts and tells a data-driven story suitable for both technical and non-technical audiences.

---

## Project Goals
- Extract and combine 5 years of historical weather data.
- Perform data cleaning and transformation.
- Visualize weather patterns using clear, intuitive charts.
- Present findings in a storytelling format for easy understanding.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Pandas** (Data Handling)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (Visualization)

---

## Data Source
- [Data Gov SG](https://data.gov.sg/) – Historical 24-hour weather forecasts.

## Key Visualizations
1. **Monthly Average Humidity (2020–2024)**  
   📈 Displays high and low humidity trends, highlighting Singapore’s consistently humid tropical climate.

## Interpretation Highlights
- **Humidity** remains stable between 85%-95% (high) and 55%-65% (low), with minor seasonal fluctuations.
- **Wind Speeds** peak early each year during the Northeast Monsoon.
- **Thundery Showers** dominate forecasts, while rare weather events like haze are linked to regional environmental factors.
